MDX lets you write rich, component-driven content using Markdown syntax together with embedded React components. This hybrid approach keeps writing ergonomic for authors while enabling interactive and reusable UI patterns for engineers.

## Why MDX?

- Familiar authoring: Use standard Markdown for prose and code blocks.
- Component power: Embed interactive components (callouts, examples, demos) directly inside content.
- Maintainability: Reuse layout and design system components across articles for consistent presentation.

## Getting Started (Next.js App Router)

1. Add MDX support to your Next.js project. The official guide shows how to configure `@next/mdx` and enable `md`/`mdx` page extensions.
2. Place MDX files in a content folder (for example, `/content`) and import them dynamically in route pages.
3. Export metadata and/or a default component from each MDX file. The default export becomes the rendered post component.

Example dynamic import (App Router route):

```tsx
const { default: Post } = await import(`@/content/${slug}.mdx`)
return <Post />
```

## Structuring Articles

- Frontmatter: Export a `metadata` object with `title`, `description`, `date`, and `author` for SEO and listing pages.
- Layout: Wrap content in a shared layout that applies site chrome, meta tags, and MDX components.
- Components: Keep presentational components (e.g., `Callout`, `AuthorBio`) in a shared `components/` folder and import them in MDX when needed.

## Using Shared MDX Components

Create an `mdx-components.tsx` that exports your MDX components mapping (headings, images, code blocks). Provide that mapping to MDX via the App Router layout or an MDX provider so the entire site shares a consistent look.

## Images and Performance

- Prefer Next.js `Image` for optimized loading. In MDX, replace `img` with a wrapper component that uses `next/image`.
- Use meaningful `alt` text and consider responsive `sizes` for better CLS and bandwidth usage.

## Accessibility & SEO

- Use semantic HTML for headings and lists.
- Include metadata (`title`, `description`, `date`, `author`) and render structured data when appropriate.

## Best Practices

- Keep MDX files focused: prefer small, single-topic posts.
- Avoid heavy logic inside MDX; import small interactive components if you need interactivity.
- Lint and format MDX like other code: use Prettier and consistent style rules.

## Example: Simple Callout Component

You can import and use components inside MDX like this:

```jsx
import { Callout } from '@/components/Callout'

<Callout>Use MDX to combine prose and UI components.</Callout>
```

## Conclusion

MDX is a practical way to manage content that needs both the readability of Markdown and the flexibility of React. With a small amount of setup in Next.js, you get composable, interactive, and maintainable articles that scale with your design system.
