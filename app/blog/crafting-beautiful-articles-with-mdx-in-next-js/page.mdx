## Why use MDX for articles?

MDX lets you write markdown-style content while embedding React components and interactive bits where needed. That makes it ideal for technical articles, tutorials, and marketing pages where you want both content clarity and component-driven interactivity.

> MDX combines the simplicity of markdown with the power of React — the best of both worlds for content-driven sites.

## Quick example

You can import components or include JSX inline directly inside an MDX file:

```jsx
import { Callout } from '@/components/Callout'

export default function Post() {
	return (
		<>
			<h2>Example</h2>
			<Callout>MDX lets you embed components like this.</Callout>
		</>
	)
}
```

## Writing for clarity

- Start with a short dek (summary) under the title.
- Use subheadings to break up long sections.
- Prefer short paragraphs and bulleted lists for skimmability.

### Small tips

- Use fenced code blocks for examples.
- Use blockquotes for important asides.
- Add metadata (author/date) in frontmatter for programmatic use.

## Conclusion

MDX is a practical way to author content-rich pages in Next.js. Combine it with a shared `mdx-components.tsx` and a simple layout to get consistent, professional-looking articles across your site.

Thanks for reading. If you'd like, I can also add a shared `Callout` component and a small author bio component to the project.
